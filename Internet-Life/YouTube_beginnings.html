    <h1 style=border-color:green;color:red;text-size:130%>My First YouTube Channel:</h1>
    <p1 style=border-color:green;color:red;text-size:130%>So my first YouTube channel was complete and utter cringe. Literally. Watching now, my 8 year old voice sounds like a squeaker in Voice Chat. Also, it for some reason was decided by me to put my first AND last name. If this wasn't the case or I still had access to the channel, I would probably show it. Also, I don't have Neocities supporter thing so I can't just use YT5S to download the video and upload to Neocities for the cringe. Maybe if I were to reupload, but I am too lazy to do that.</p1>

    <h2 style=border-color:yellow;color:blue;text-size:130%>The Digital Cheese Channel</h2>
    <p2 style=border-color:yellow;color:blue;text-size:130%>My 2nd channel was Digital Cheese. I will link it later. Before I knew it, this name would define the names of a lot of my online accounts including this blog being named DC's Blog. Very cool. I made a video 2 days after my birthday. It was a Minecraft video. Still with a squeaker voice as I was 10. I basically played video games though and watched. Then when I was 11, things would change for the fun. I engauged in a lot of wars with people on the internet. I wasn't really controversial and still am not. I basically argued over pokemon games. That was fun honestly and it definitely was how everyone should learn that reporting on the internet is useless. I already knew that. Most people would likely at 11 be weak in terms of the internet. They would probably be those people posting the memes that then get reposted in r/im14andthisisdeep on Reddit. Ok maybe I am being a little over confident however still. I always questioned places like TikTok too. It just didn't make any sense. Thanks to the internet and having experience, I was already well ahead of a lot of people in terms of that. Some people at school question why I don't like TikTok and I just say that every TikTok video is just people dancing. Sure I guess if you very specifically set it up, you could get good stuff though just like almost every site. As it turned out, I had multiple reasons and not just "TikTok dance is all there is and dat stoooooooopid". Apparently it harvests more data than even places like Facebook and YouTube along with also being proven to shorten attention spans. It all makes sense too. While there was Musical.ly and Vine, they were no where near as popular and had to work with older technology which probably didn't allow things to get out of hand like this. In 2021 though, things would change for the worst.</p2>

    <h3 style=border-color:blue;color:yellow;text-size:130%>The Downfall</h3>
<p3 style=border-color:blue;color:yellow;text-size:130%>In 2021, YouTube decided to start removing dislikes. Now, Return YouTube Dislike exists and is even on the Chrome Web Store, but still. This was a major change. You can also use a downgraded mobile app, though this still sucks. Luckily, YouTube hasn't removed dislikes from their API so we are winning still. I still use YouTube still, however not as much for uploading. That is now over on sites like Odysee and BitView. New YouTube just kinda sucks now. It's sad as I watched lots of YouTubers in 2016 on a handme down iPhone 5S and had a fun time. Also, I have no clue why they removed messaging people and having friends. When I used SubRocks before it's shutdown and still while using BitView, it had a message feature. With the 2009 design, it even had groups. That is crazy to think about when comparing to modern YouTube. Imagine if YouTube was still as good as 2016 and before. Though I wouldn't be surprised if YouTube channels like Elsagate managed to make YouTube a whole lot more strict. Just fun isn't it. Glad there are alternatives nowadays. YouTube has basically become ThemTube. They should rename the site honestly. The only luck of getting out of a strike if it happens to you is begging YouTube on Twitter after already having a following. Doesn't make sense as you would think that you shouldn't have to cry on Twitter for that to work.</p3>
