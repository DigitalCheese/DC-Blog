<p2 style=color:red>Favorite Games:</p2>
<br>
<p3>- Destiny 2</p3>
<br>
<p4>Destiny 2 is a very fun game in my opinion. I do think they have a few too many microtransactions though. I originally played Destiny 1 in 2016 when I got my PS4. It was very fun and I still sometimes go back to that game a bit. Overall, 8.7/10 is my rating.</p4>
<br>
<p3>- Minecraft</p3>
<br>
<p4>Minecraft is very fun on Java. Legacy is also fun too. Wii U, PS4, and Java are my favorite versions. Wii U has free online and voice chat along with 4 ppl on one system which is very cool. PS4 has voice chat and up to 16 people, but no free online. Also, you can go back to legacy easily on PS4 as of now. Java has lots of mods, skins, texture packs, custom servers, and more which I love. A good properly made server can easily outbeat the stupid Realm system. I give this game a 9.4/10 rating because it is that good.</p4>
<br>
<p3>- Pokemon BW2</p3>
<br>
<p4>Pokemon Black and White 2 are very good games. The story is the best in the pokemon franchise, has free online, works on every single DS system (from OG to N2DSXL), has voice chat, has video chat on DSi/3DS, and more. Also, unlike Pokemon Sword and Shield, there are battle videos, all the pokemon that existed then, and my favorite part is the fact that your character nearly (spoiler alert) suddenly dies due to the bad guys. I give this game a rating of 9.8/10 because it is beautiful.</p4>
