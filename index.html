    <h1 style=color:purple;text-size:200%>Hello, welcome to my amazing blog. This has details about stuff and even some javascript games I am making. Enjoy it.</h1>

    <h2 style=color:red;text-size:150%;font-family;verdana>I am a gamer, animator, and programmer who calls themselves Digital Cheese with the short version being DC. It is a cool name. I made the name years ago. Originally, I would have my name be PizzaGamer0616 but other than that not sounding good, it had numbers. PizzaGamer5027 was better but had numbers. Then I randomly thought "Digital Cheese" as I wanted a cool name for my YouTube channel. Little did I know, this would be the main name I would use on all sorts of sites assuming I could fit it. If I couldn't, I used stuff like DC, DC TheGamr, CoolGamrDC, and probably some I am missing. For many years, I was basically only using YouTube as my social media platform other than Discord and Roblox. There was Steam and Miiverse too luckily. Didn't do much outside those places. Then later I discovered much better. There are links detailing this type of stuff that are being updated occansionally.</h2>
