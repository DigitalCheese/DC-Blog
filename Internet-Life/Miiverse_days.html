<h1 style=color:lime>This was the start of my days on the Internet. I managed to get around parental controls when I was 5 and got onto Miiverse via my Wii U. Somehow, I didn't get caught. I made a whole lot of cringe posts but I at least could be argued as a poet there. When I started I wrote 2 pieces of text that shall now become things on r/im14andthisisdeep so enjoy the horrible stuff below.</h1>

<p1 style=color:white>I Like With Mario And amiibos Games and The Games are Hard and a game is Easy and A game Is Normal and a game is Very Hard But I don't have Time |</p1>
<p2 style=color:red>But Mario Has The Power To Save The Day And PrincessPeach Is With Boswer @Mushroom Kingdom At Boswer</p2>

<h2 style=color:lime>These were my amazing bodies of text that got probably 0 Yeahs. I might give my NNID eventually, but that had my last name as part of it which was stupid of an idea. Luckily, I also had an NNID called SuperFireLuigi1 with exactly 1 post and nobody cares then. You can go to archiverse.guide so you can access the 1 post there. I will also take friend requests on Wii U still. I mostly used Miiverse on Wii U as you could tell</h2>

<h2 style=color:green>Miiverse was cool, however it sadly shut down in 2017. Took until around 2018 or 2019 for me to learn that. Miiverse was cool honestly. It is sad that it shut down. It was chaotic though. I never got a ban somehow despite my post easily being able to count as spam. Miiverse was fun. Luckily, clones like Juxtaposition, Rverse, and CloneMii now exist. Miiverse is still kinda alive as a result. I use 3 of the available clones. CloneMii, Rverse, and Juxt. They are pretty good. I like them a lot. CloneMii works on 3DS, Wii U, and has a desktop version. Rverse is 3DS only as of now sadly. Juxt is Wii U only as of now but the creators don't care about custom images if it's not NSFW, so with changing some stupid stuff, you can technically use Juxt on PC as well. Not easy though and I can't figure it out.</h2>
